# NeuroPocket: Offline Image Classification PWA

NeuroPocket is a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that enables offline image classification using machine learning. Built with React, TypeScript, and TensorFlow.js, it allows users to create and train custom image classification models directly in their browser, with full offline functionality.

## üåü Features

- **Fully Offline Capable**: Train and use models without an internet connection
- **Cross-Platform Support**: 
  - Native Android app
  - PWA support for iOS and desktop
  - Web browser access
- **Custom Model Training**: Create and train your own image classification models
- **Real-Time Classification**: Instant predictions using device camera or uploaded images
- **Persistent Storage**: Save models and data locally
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all device sizes

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn

- `ModelTrainer`: Manages model training process
- `ImageClassifier`: Handles real-time classification
- `StorageManager`: Manages offline data persistence

## Development Setup

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the web app
npm run build

# Add platforms
npx cap add @capacitor-community/electron  # Add Electron support
npx cap add android                       # Add Android support (optional)
```

### Development Workflow

#### Web Development
```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```

#### Electron Development
```bash
# After making changes to the main web app:
npm run build                              # Build the web app
npx cap copy @capacitor-community/electron # Copy web assets to electron

# Start Electron app in development mode
cd electron
npm run electron:start-live
```

#### Android Development
```bash
# After making changes to the main web app:
npm run build    # Build the web app
npx cap sync     # Sync changes to Android

# Open in Android Studio
npx cap open android
```

#### Building Applications

##### Electron
```bash
cd electron
npm run electron:make
```
The built application will be available in the `electron/dist` directory.

##### Android
Open the project in Android Studio and use the Build menu to create APK or Android App Bundle.

## Project Structure
- `/src` - Main web application code
- `/electron` - Electron-specific code and configuration
  - `/electron/src` - Electron main process code
  - `/electron/app` - Built web app (don't edit directly)

## Important Notes
- The electron folder should be kept in version control as it contains custom configurations
- The android folder should NOT be kept in version control - each developer should create their own using `npx cap add android`
- Always run appropriate sync commands after making changes to the main web application:
  - For Electron: `npm run build && npx cap copy @capacitor-community/electron`
  - For Android: `npm run build && npx cap sync`
- Window size and other Electron-specific configurations can be found in `electron/src/index.ts`

## .gitignore Recommendations
```
# Android
/android

# Electron build outputs
/electron/dist
/electron/build
/electron/node_modules

# General
node_modules
dist
.env
```
